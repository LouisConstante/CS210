Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project implements a clock that displays the time in two formats. It allows the user to add a minute, hour, and second.

What did you do particularly well?
The formatting on the user's end is readable and easy to use.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
The code does not correctly use the principle of encapsulation. It could be improved by declaring some of the variables as private.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Outputting the program with proper format and no errors was a challenge. I overcame this challenge by printing the buffer more often. In the future, Iâ€™ll spend less time fixing that particular issue. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
In order to fix the stated issue, I had to learn more about exactly how output buffers operate. This will be a useful skill in future projects.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The use of a while loop to keep the program running until the user chooses to exit makes the program more readable.
